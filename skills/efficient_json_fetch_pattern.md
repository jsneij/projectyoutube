# Efficient JSON Fetch Pattern

A pattern for projects that download large lists from an API into a local JSON file, where you want fast incremental updates and clear terminal feedback.

---

## Core idea

Split every run into two questions:
1. **What changed on the remote since my last fetch?**
2. **Of what changed, what do I actually care about?**

Only download what's needed to answer question 2.

---

## 1. Check before you fetch

Most APIs offer a `modifiedsince` (or equivalent) parameter. Use it.

On every run after the first:
- Pass `modifiedsince = last_fetch_date + 1 day` to the API
- If the response is empty → print "Nothing changed" and exit immediately
- If items came back → only process those

The `+1 day` offset avoids re-fetching items that were last modified on the same calendar day as your previous fetch (most APIs use inclusive date comparisons).

**First run:** no date to compare against, so fetch everything. This seeds the local JSON and the fetch log.

---

## 2. Keep a lightweight fetch log

Don't re-parse your full JSON to detect changes. Instead, maintain a small `fetch_log.json` alongside your main output file. It stores only the fields you want to track per item — not the full data.

```json
{
  "fetched_at": "2026-03-14T10:22:00+00:00",
  "counts": { "owned": 87, "wishlist_total": 34 },
  "items": {
    "item_id_123": {
      "name": "Item Name",
      "your_field_1": "value",
      "your_field_2": 5
    }
  }
}
```

On the next run:
- Load the log → show previous state before fetching
- After fetching → compare new data against log → show changes
- Save updated log

---

## 3. Track only what you control

Only include fields in the fetch log that **you** modify — not fields that change due to other users' activity (view counts, global ratings, rankings, etc.). This keeps the change report meaningful.

Examples of fields worth tracking:
- Status / category (owned, wishlist, etc.)
- Your personal rating
- Your comment or note
- Acquisition or creation date
- Play/watch count (if you log it)
- Priority or sort order you assigned

---

## 4. Merge, don't replace

When only a subset of items changed, don't overwrite your full JSON with just those items. Instead:
1. Load the existing full JSON into an in-memory index (`id → item`)
2. Parse the changed items from the API response
3. For each changed item, update its entry in the index
4. Re-categorize and write the full merged dataset back out

This keeps your full local copy intact while only touching what actually changed.

---

## 5. Terminal output structure

Every run should print in this order:

```
[Previous state]          ← from fetch log: counts at last run, timestamp

[1/N] Checking for changes since YYYY-MM-DD...
  ✓ X item(s) changed     ← or: "Nothing changed" in green → exit

[2/N] Parsing changed items...
[3/N] Fetching detail data for X items...   ← only if needed
[4/N] Writing output...

[Changes since last fetch]   ← diff between old log and new data
[Current summary]            ← counts and totals after this run
```

---

## 6. Colors

Use ANSI codes to make the output scannable at a glance:

```python
YELLOW = "\033[33m"   # changes and updates
GREEN  = "\033[32m"   # no changes / success / nothing to do
RESET  = "\033[0m"
```

- **Green** → nothing changed, everything up to date
- **Yellow** → something changed (new items, updated fields, removed items)
- Default → progress steps, counts, file paths
